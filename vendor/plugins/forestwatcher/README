The Rails Forestwatcher plugins hooks into Rails' exception handling and posts any production errors to the specified URL. To capture these exception posts we've also written a small Camping application:

  https://fngtps.com/svn/forestwatcher/trunk
  
The plugin adds two methods to you application. You can either post all exceptions to Forestwatcher:

  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    report_errors_to 'https://fwatch.com/myappname'
  end

Optionally it supports HTTP Basic Authentication:

  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    report_errors_to 'https://fwatch.com/myappname', :username => 'john', :password => 'secret'
  end

You can also post exceptions from your controllers:

  class WebserviceRequest < ApplicationController
    def create
      Webservice.post(params[:webservice])
    rescue Webservice::Exception => e
      post_exception :url => 'https://fwatch.com/myappname-webservice-create', :exception => e, :environment => request.env, :params => params
    end
  end
